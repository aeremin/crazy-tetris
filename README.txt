CrazyTetris
===========

A tetris-like game where several players act simultaneously trying to knock
down each other with bonuses that occasionally appear in the playing field.
See sample screenshot for examples of ways in which you can diversify your
opponent's life.

We didn't use git when the game was written, so the history was restored from
the tarballs that we send each other to exchange patches. That's why commit
messages are so informative :-)
